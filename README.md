# JavaScript Concepts Quiz

## Description

My Quiz is designed as a study material to help me stay review concepts I learn while coding in JS. I will continue to add more questions as I learn more about JS that way I can come back periodically and review. This project uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Most of the HTML is generated in my JS by using query selectors and DOM events. There is some basic styling done in both the CSS code and in my JS file as the HTML elements are generated dynamically. I also utilize Local Storage to save quiz high scores so I can track my all time best. Upon completing the quiz or running out of time, the user is prompted to enter their initials in order to save their score and will be shown a list of up to the top 10 all time scores.
